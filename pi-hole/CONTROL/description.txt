Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole (and optionally a DHCP server), intended for use on a private network. It is designed for use on embedded devices with network capability, such as the Raspberry Pi, but it can be used on other machines running Linux and cloud implementations.

Pi-hole has the ability to block traditional website advertisements as well as advertisements in unconventional places, such as smart TVs and mobile operating system advertisements.

REMEMBER !!! to change your router DNS = your Asustor ip address.

Notes:
1. The docker version is maintained by https://pi-hole.net/.
2. Best use with Chrome extensions "Switch for PiHole"
3. Do not install together Adguard-home. Port conflict.
4. DHCP function never tested.
